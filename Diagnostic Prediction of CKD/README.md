**Kidney-Disease-Analysis**
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) is a general term for 
multiple heterogeneous diseases in the kidneys that occurs when kidneys are damaged 
and cannot filter blood properly.

Over time this could result in the development of severe c
ardiovascular disease, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), and may even lead to death. 
The disease affects 10 per cent of the population worldwide and millions of lives are lost 
every year with conditions worse particularly in the developing nations due to lack of early 
diagnosis and affordable treatment. 

Since CKD depends on various factors like sugar, specific gravity, anemia 
Machine-learning based systems can be developed based on these factors so that early prediction and diagnostic
results can be achieved in a fairly short time, thereby allowing doctors to treat patients more effectively. 
This project proposes utilization of various techniques such as data pre- processing, data visualization, 
feature-selection algorithms (SelectKBest, chi2) and prediction algorithm (XGBoost-eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to 
determine CKD. Eventually RandomisedSearchCV is used for tuning the hyperparameters.
